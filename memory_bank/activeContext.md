# OCR Benchmarking Active Context

## Current Focus
- Testing and optimizing Tesseract OCR implementation
- Preparing for EasyOCR integration
- Completing visualization tools for benchmark results

## Key Decisions
- Privacy-first approach prioritizing local processing where possible
- Comprehensive abstract interface for consistent OCR integration
- Modular preprocessing pipeline with OCR-specific optimizations
- MacOS development environment with optional Colab integration for GPU access

## Implementation Priorities
1. Complete Tesseract OCR testing and documentation
2. Implement EasyOCR adapter and compare with Tesseract
3. Add visualization tools for benchmark results
4. Gradually expand to more complex OCR methods

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.12+ with type hints and dataclasses
- Core dependencies: numpy, opencv, pydantic
- OCR engines: pytesseract (with more to be added)
- Benchmarking framework with standardized metrics
- Image preprocessing utilities for OCR optimization

## Current Phase
Core Framework Implementation - Finalizing the basic OCR benchmarking framework and Tesseract integration

## Achievements
- Created comprehensive OCR processor interface
- Implemented benchmarking metrics and runner
- Built image preprocessing utilities
- Completed Tesseract OCR adapter
- Created example scripts for testing

## Next Steps
- Test Tesseract with real document images
- Document installation and usage instructions
- Create visualization tools for benchmark results
- Begin work on EasyOCR adapter
