# OCR Benchmarking - Active Context

## Current Implementation Focus
- Enhanced OCR evaluation metrics
- Multi-metric visualization framework
- Table-based summary visualization
- Text normalization for improved comparison
- Google Colab compatibility for GPU acceleration

## Active Code Components
- `ocr_comparison.py`: Core evaluation framework with metrics and visualization
- `ocr_methods.py`: Implementations of 4 OCR methods (Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, Keras-OCR)
- `run_benchmark.py`: Command-line script for running benchmarks
- `colab_notebook.py`: Colab-formatted notebook for cloud GPU access
- `README.md`: Documentation for both local and Google Colab usage

## Current Evaluation Metrics
- Text similarity using SequenceMatcher
- Word Error Rate (WER)
- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Common Word Accuracy
- Processing time
- Success rate

## Current Visualization Components
- Bar charts for individual metrics
- 2x2 metric comparison grid
- Boxplot for text length ratio
- Summary table with highlighted best performers
- JSON export for detailed metric analysis

## Current Progress Blockers
- None for current phase

## Next Implementation Steps
- Prepare for VLM integration:
  - Research self-hosting requirements for VLM models
  - Evaluate data privacy considerations for each VLM option
  - Design VLM adapter interfaces
  - Plan Colab integration for GPU acceleration
  - Document VLM implementation roadmap

## Solved Problems
- Improved text comparison with multiple metrics
- Created comprehensive visualization framework
- Fixed data type handling in table visualization
- Integrated text normalization for better comparison
- Updated Google Colab notebook with full evaluation metrics
- Structured evaluation results for export and analysis
