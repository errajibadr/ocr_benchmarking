# OCR Benchmarking Active Context

## Current Focus
- Testing and optimizing EasyOCR implementation
- Comparing EasyOCR performance with Tesseract
- Preparing for PaddleOCR integration

## Key Decisions
- Privacy-first approach prioritizing local processing where possible
- Comprehensive abstract interface for consistent OCR integration
- Multiple OCR engines with standardized benchmarking
- Support for both CPU and GPU acceleration depending on availability
- Enhanced text extraction visualization and storage

## Implementation Priorities
1. Complete EasyOCR testing and benchmarking
2. Document comparison between Tesseract and EasyOCR
3. Implement PaddleOCR adapter
4. Prepare for Vision Language Model evaluation

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.12+ with type hints and dataclasses
- Core dependencies: numpy, opencv, pydantic
- OCR engines: pytesseract, easyocr (with paddleocr to come)
- Benchmarking framework with standardized metrics
- Image preprocessing utilities optimized for each OCR engine

## Current Phase
EasyOCR Integration - Implementing and testing the EasyOCR adapter to compare with Tesseract

## Achievements
- Created comprehensive OCR processor interface
- Implemented benchmarking metrics and runner
- Built image preprocessing utilities for multiple OCR engines
- Completed Tesseract OCR implementation and testing
- Implemented EasyOCR adapter with multi-language support
- Added text extraction storage for human review
- Fixed Pydantic v2 serialization issues

## Next Steps
- Test EasyOCR with same dataset as Tesseract
- Analyze performance differences between Tesseract and EasyOCR
- Create performance comparison report
- Begin PaddleOCR implementation
- Explore handling specialized document types (forms, tables)
