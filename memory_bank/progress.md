## Completion Status
- Project Setup Phase: 100% complete
- Core Framework Phase: 100% complete
- Tesseract OCR Phase: 100% complete
- EasyOCR Phase: 90% complete
- PaddleOCR Phase: 0% complete
- VLM Integration Planning: 0% complete

## Implementation Notes
- Initial focus on traditional OCR methods due to privacy constraints and local processing capability
- Created comprehensive OCR processor interface to standardize benchmarking
- EasyOCR offers potentially better handling of complex layouts and handwriting compared to Tesseract
- Added better text extraction saving functionality for easier human review
- Implemented "lazy loading" for EasyOCR to prevent unnecessary model downloads when initializing
- Added comprehensive CLI interfaces for both Tesseract and EasyOCR examples
