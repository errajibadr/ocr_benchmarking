# OCR Benchmarking Progress

## Project Initialization (Completed)
- Created project repository structure
- Established Memory Bank for project context
- Documented OCR methods to be evaluated
- Set up phased implementation plan
- Defined privacy-first approach to OCR evaluation
- Created base project documentation
- Set up Python environment with dependencies
- Updated pyproject.toml with required dependencies

## Core Framework Implementation (Current)
- Created essential directory structure
- Implemented abstract OCR processor interface
- Built basic benchmarking framework
- Implemented metric calculation utilities
- Added image processing utilities
- Created data loading utilities
- Implemented Tesseract OCR adapter
- Created example script to test Tesseract implementation

## Next Implementation Milestone: Traditional OCR Evaluation
- Test and optimize Tesseract OCR on sample datasets
- Implement EasyOCR adapter
- Compare performance between Tesseract and EasyOCR
- Document findings and performance characteristics

## Completion Status
- Project Setup Phase: 100% complete
- Core Framework Phase: 90% complete
- Tesseract OCR Phase: 50% complete
- EasyOCR Phase: 0% complete
- PaddleOCR Phase: 0% complete
- VLM Integration Planning: 0% complete

## Implementation Notes
- Initial focus on traditional OCR methods due to privacy constraints and local processing capability
- Created comprehensive OCR processor interface to standardize benchmarking
- Implemented modular design to allow easy addition of new OCR methods
- Added extensive image preprocessing capabilities to improve OCR accuracy
- Framework allows for quantitative comparison between different OCR methods
