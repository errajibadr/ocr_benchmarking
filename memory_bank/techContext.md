# OCR Technical Context

## Traditional OCR Solutions

### Tesseract OCR
- Open-source OCR engine maintained by Google
- Can run locally without data leaving premises
- Good support for multiple languages
- CPU-based, works on macOS without CUDA
- Moderate accuracy on clean documents, struggles with complex layouts

### EasyOCR
- Python library with pre-trained models
- Supports 80+ languages
- Can run on CPU but performs better with GPU
- Better text detection in complex layouts than Tesseract
- Higher accuracy but slower on CPU-only environments

### PaddleOCR
- Developed by Baidu
- High-accuracy multilingual OCR system
- Optimized for both CPU and GPU environments
- Strong with complex layouts and multiple languages
- May have performance limitations on macOS without CUDA

## Vision Language Models (VLMs)

### Qwen-2.5-VL (3B to 72B)
- Alibaba's multimodal model with strong visual understanding
- Resource-intensive, requires significant GPU memory
- Can be self-hosted with appropriate hardware
- High accuracy potential for complex document understanding

### OlmOCR
- Recent specialized OCR VLM
- Designed specifically for document understanding
- Needs evaluation for self-hosting requirements
- Potentially high accuracy for complex document layouts

### Mistral OCR
- Fast processing capabilities
- Potential data privacy concerns if using API services
- Lower resource requirements than larger VLMs
- May offer good balance of performance vs. resource usage

### Google Gemini Flash
- Highly capable multimodal model
- Requires API access (data leaves premises)
- Significant data privacy concerns
- Very high accuracy potential but conflicts with privacy requirements

## Deployment Considerations

### Local Deployment (macOS)
- No CUDA support limits GPU acceleration options
- CPU-only operation for most solutions
- May impact performance of more resource-intensive methods

### Cloud/Colab Deployment
- Provides GPU access for better performance
- Temporary data exposure during processing
- Requires additional data transfer/management workflows
- Good for benchmarking but may not align with production privacy requirements
